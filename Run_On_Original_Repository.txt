------------------------------------------------------TRAIN THE YOLOv7 MODEL ON THE CUSTOM DATASET------------------------------------------------------

Git clone this repository : https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.git on your local machine

Edit requirements.txt file and remove 11th and 12th line from it and save it.

Run this following commands on the terminal:

touch requirements_cpu.txt
touch requirements_gpu.txt
	
Now put the following code in the requirements_cpu.txt (make sure their is no space in the starting of every line):

# FOR Torch CPU

-i https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

torch==1.11.0+cpu
torchvision==0.12.0+cpu
	
And put the following code in requirements_gpu.txt (make sure their is no space in the starting of every line):

# For GPU

-i https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

torch==1.11.0+cu113 
torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 

After making the .txt files make conda environment in your local machine, activate it and then run the following code in the terminal :

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt
pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt

Now go to the following path cfg/training/ and copy yolov7.yaml file and paste it in the same folder and rename it as yolov7_custom.yaml after that open it and make nc: 1 (1 is just for 1 class you can edit based on your preference of classes) and then save it.

Now go to the data folder and make some following changes inside the folder(make sure the names of the folders are as it is):
	1. Make two folder name train and val.
	2. Inside the train folder make two sub-folder images and labels.
	3. Inside the val folder make two sub-folder images and labels.
	4. Copy the coco.yaml file and paste it in the same directory and rename it as coco_custom.yaml and put the following text inside it.
		train: ./data/train
		val: ./data/val

		# number of classes
		nc: 1 # You can change the classes based on your preference)

		# class names
		names: ['person'] # Edit the names of the classes also based on your preference like ['person', 'car', ....]

Make sure the labels folder have the annotated data in the yolo accepted format : <object-class> <x> <y> <width> <height> e.g. 0 0.76484375 0.43046875 0.0609375 0.1734375

After Doing all the above steps you are ready to train your model on the custom dataset.

To train the model run the following code in the terminal (Make sure you are still have activated the conda environment):

python3 train.py --workers 4 --device 0 --batch-size 8 --epochs 100 --img 640 640 --data data/coco_custom.yaml --hyp data/hyp.scratch.custom.yaml --cfg cfg/training/yolov7_custom.yaml --name yolov7-custom --weights yolov7.pt

After Training is completed you need to go the following directory to get the trained weights file : ./runs/train/weights/ now their is best.pt file generated copy the location of the best.pt

Now for running the inference on the image or detecting the objects in the image run the following code:

python3 detect.py --weights ./runs/train/weights/best.pt --conf 0.5 --img-size 640 --source image.jpg --no-trace

Results will be stored on the following location : ./runs/detect/exp/image.jpg
